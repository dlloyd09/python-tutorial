# stairs.py
#
# Build a right-align set of stairs of 
# the specified height and width
# 
# Example (height 3):
#   x
#  xx
# xxx
#
# Example (height 5):
#
#     x
#    xx
#   xxx
#  xxxx
# xxxxx
####################################

# import any necessary modules

# prompt the user for a height in [0, 23] (re-prompting if needed!)

# print the stairs!

## HINTS:
## 1. You'll probably find it easiest to print a full square of x's first
## 2. Try and print a left-aligned set of stairs next... you'll probably find it easier!
## 3. Then think about what else you could print to make things right-aligned!
## 4. We teach a similar problem to this in CS50 called "Mario". The below video teaches the concepts in a programming
##    language called 'C', but the same basic ideas in that walkthrough are still relevant, just using Python instead!
